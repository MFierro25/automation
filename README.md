# Lab: Automation

Given a document potential-contacts, find and collect all email addresses and phone numbers.<br>

Phone numbers may be in various formats.
(xxx) yyy-zzzz, yyy-zzzz, xxx-yyy-zzzz, etc.<br>

- phone numbers with missing area code should presume 206

- phone numbers should be stored in xxx-yyy-zzzz format.

- Once emails and phone numbers are found they should be stored in two separate documents.

The information should be sorted in ascending order.

Duplicate entries are not allowed.
